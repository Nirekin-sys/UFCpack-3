This is a modpack for **Yairm's Unciv**, introducing 4 new unique civilizations with their own unique units and play styles.
## Civilizations:
### Vostaz
* The Vostaz are an isolationist and socially restrained society, exercising their culture and civilization under an almost omnipresent authoritarian rule. While their social mobility has been completely petrified, their ability to respond and act against national threats has increased significantly.

  * Unique Unit: Guardsman
  >The frontliners and enforcers of the national policy of the Vostaz. The Guardsman, while not having significant offensive capabilities, are toughened up by multiple defensive promotions.
  
  * Unique Improvement: Border Outpost
  >Dotting the motherland of the Vostaz, the Border Outposts are strategic improvements that aid in choking enemy forces, or perhaps fortifying a vulnerable location from rival militaries. While it's defense is neglegible (it has to be manned), it's tactical value is no exaggeration, as it can quickly wear down and/or stall enemy forces advancing on the motherland.

### Caziana
* The busy commercial hubs and trading nodes of the Cazianas are a staple of the nation. While not retaining a mighty merchantly advantage over it's other contemporaries, it cements it's trading power by force, control of the seas and self-sufficiency.

  * Unique Unit: Gigantereme
  >A gigantic naval-going vessel based on archaic blueprints of classical warships. While augmented with contemporary weaponry, it's huge size hosting a legion of ship crews has allowed it to be an almost self-reliant menace of the waters. Carrying the banners and dictations of the Caziana on it's titanic sails and towering masts.
  
  * Unique Building: Canal
  >The canals of Caziana are notable pieces of construction, composed of a zigzagging networks of over and underground water tunnels and man-made acquifers to direct and manipulate the flow of water from the seas, completely unique to their culture; an improvement that augments a coastal tile's profitability and habitability if used correctly.

### Taltug
* A strange peoples, who has founded their society on the fringe wastes of the barren icelands and tundras and called it their homeland. This should not be a case for underestimation however, as they have sufficely adapted and grown to be able to suitably live in such conditions.

  * Unique Building: Ice Sanctuary
  >Carved into the center of many of the Taltug's Ice Metropolises, or perhaps imported and maintained in their more arid cities; the Ice Sanctuaries serve as a comprehensive and cultural rallypoint for the Taltug. Carved and etched into the ice, stories of old, prayers to their Gods and the names and deeds of people long gone. An edifying anchor for a socially-unique people.
  
  * Unique Improvement: Snowcroft
  >The Taltug has mastered a form of polar hydrophonics, allowing them to begin agriculture in an otherwise anti-agronomical environment, utilizing techniques and methods of water manipulation and heating apparatuses. These Snowcrofts are often on par with it's more dry cousins.
  
### Ashipur
* Deep in the wetlands and noisy greeneries of the world, the Ashipur find themselves occupied with the business of thriving in such conditions, enriching themselves culturally and scientifically, while enjoying a suffice amount of luxury despite all conditions.

  * Unique Unit: Jungle Elephant
  >The domestication of the Jungle Elephant by the Ashipurians is a unique occurance. While their inexperience with archery (given their environment), the Jungle Elephant has been turned into an almost autonomous wrecking ball in the battlefield, not as large as their other cousins for siege purposes, but bulky and aggressive enough as a formidable rank-breaker in the battlefield.
 
  * Unique Building: Ashikunj
  > A great piece of civil engineering. Within the decorated and robust stone walls of an Ashikunj, batches and crews of dedicated dendrologists, herablists and practicioners of plant breeding work in day and night to produce and create surpluses of bountiful plantlife and trees that can either be used for agriculture or other tasks (woodwork or medicine). A cultural and scientific phenomenon completely unique to the Ashipur.
